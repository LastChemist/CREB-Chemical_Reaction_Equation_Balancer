# CREB (Chemical Reaction Equation Balancer) Project

    This Python project aims to balance chemical reaction equations. While the code isn‚Äôt fully compliant with PEP8 conventions yet (due to my initial development process), I encourage contributions from the community. Feel free to fork the project and submit pull requests! üòä

## Naming Style Conventions in CREB Project:

### Variables:
- Use snake case for variable names (e.g., `reactants_list`).
- If possible explicitly define variable types (e.g., `reactant_list: list[str] = []`).

### Functions:
- Start function names with a lowercase letter and use camel case (e.g., `equationRewriter`, `equationFileGenerator`).
- Specify the return type (e.g., `def sum(num1: float, num2: float) -> float`).

### Classes:
- Class definitions should follow camel case (PEP8) conventions (e.g., `class Util`, `class LinearEquationsSystem`).

### Modules:
- Module names should also be in camel case.
- Keep module names short and distinct from class names to avoid confusion.
